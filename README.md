# Abstract 
 
 Cryptographic algorithms are used for important tasks such as data encryption, authentication, and digital signatures, but one problem has to be solved to enable these algorithms: binding cryptographic keys to machine or user identities. Public key infrastructure (PKI) systems are built to bridge useful identities (email addresses, Domain Name System addresses, etc.) and the cryptographic keys used to authenticate or encrypt data. 

1. BTC / "Bitcoin"
